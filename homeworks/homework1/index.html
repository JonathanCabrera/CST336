        <p> Welcome to my website. This website created so that you can gain some knowledge about some of the most popular programming languages used in Silicon Valley.
            These languages play a large role at many companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and many more. Each and every language has different strengths and weaknesses and usecases.
            The programming languages on this website are high level programming languages that have object oriented programming. High level programming lanaguages convert the code you write
            into a lower level programming langauge that the computer is able to use as instructions to translate that machine code. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>What is a programming langauge?</h3>
        <p>
            A programming language is a special language programmers use to develop software programs,
            scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute. The following is an index 
            of the different programming and scripting languages currently listed on our site.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What is a program?</h3>
        <p>
            A program is a group of logical, mathematical, systematical and managed functions grouped 
            together to perform a specific task.     
        </p>
        
        <h3>What is 2<sup>4</sup>?</h3>
        <p>
            it's 16. Computer at the lowest level only understand 1's and 0's
