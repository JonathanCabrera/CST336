                <p>I recently did an internship at Facebook as a Facebook University intern.
                   I mainly worked with Objective-C. In the duration of this internship I gained skills
                   that are important in the industry. I also become aware of area that I need to improve on. As
                   well as strengthen areas that I was previously weak in.
